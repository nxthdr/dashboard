              nxthdr, pronounced "Next Header", is an initiative to offer metrology capabilities to researchers and students to study and learn about the Internet.
            </p>
            <p>
              It integrates high-speed probing capabilities together with peering control, offering the community a unique platform. The nxthdr <router-link to="/docs/infrastructure">infrastructure</router-link> enables Internet-scale route tracing while managing and collecting BGP advertisements from diverse vantage points and multiple IXPs, powered by the <router-link to="/docs/as215011">as215011</router-link> network.

          <div class="alert alert-important">
            <p>Currently, nxthdr is in its early stages and not yet open to the public for experiments. However, the <router-link to="/docs/datasets">datasets</router-link> collected are already accessible.</p>

            <h3 class="section-title">Peering Platform</h3>
            <p>
              The peering platform is built around an autonomous system, <router-link to="/docs/as215011">as215011</router-link>, which advertises multiple IPv6 prefixes. This network is designed to support researchers and students in conducting Internet-scale experiments on routing and peering.
            </p>
            <p>
              BGP data is collected using <a href="https://github.com/nxthdr/risotto" target="_blank" rel="noopener">risotto</a> BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) collector. Each as215011 router sends BMP messages to risotto, which stores the updates in a ClickHouse database. By maintaining a state, risotto ensures accurate and comprehensive BGP data, which is made freely <router-link to="/docs/datasets">available</router-link> to everyone for analysis.

          <div class="content-section">
            <h3 class="section-title">Probing Platform</h3>
            <p>
              The probing platform consists of multiple servers distributed worldwide. These servers can perform high-speed traceroute-like and ping-like measurements. They advertise <router-link to="/docs/as215011">as215011</router-link> IPv6 prefixes, allowing measurements using both source unicast and anycast addresses.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a href="https://github.com/nxthdr/saimiris" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saimiris</a> is a high-speed probing pipeline that provides the essential plumbing for users to perform active measurements from the probing servers. The measurements results are stored in a ClickHouse database and made freely <router-link to="/docs/datasets">available</router-link> to everyone for analysis.
